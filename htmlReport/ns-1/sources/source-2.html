&nbsp; * CS635
&nbsp; * Lab01 - Priority Queue
&nbsp; * 9/9/24
&nbsp; * MyPriorityQueue.java
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *  This is my implementation of a priority Queue using Binary Heaps. It would not have been possible without all the
&nbsp; *  resources available online. Some of the algorithm may look similar, but I have adapted it for the purposes of this
&nbsp; *  Lab. We will go over some design chooses that I made in order of the Key Feature areas specified in the lab
&nbsp; *  assignment. There are also comments in the code to clarify what was done if the logic may take more effort to
&nbsp; *  comprehend.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *  1. Algorithm Efficiency: I choose to go with a binary heap implementation because it is more efficient than an
&nbsp; *  array or linked list implementation of a priority queue. Without going into detail of the implementations of
&nbsp; *  priority queues using an array or linked list has a time complexity of O(n) for certain operations. For a binary
&nbsp; *  heap the operation to add and remove the root which contains the high priority object is O(log_n) because as the
&nbsp; *  size of the heap grows the operation to add or remove elements is not linearly related to the size of the heap,
&nbsp; *  but dependent on how many levels an operation has to traverse down or up a tree. As the tree grows the nodes in
&nbsp; *  each level of the heap grows by a factor or 2 i.e. 1,2,4,8,16,32...
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *  In this exercise the three main methods we will go over is are adding new elements, returning high priority element,
&nbsp; *  and removing element with the highest priority.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *  * Adding new elements: To insert an object this method will add the element to the end of the heap and then use the
&nbsp; *  raise method to find its respective place in the heap. The raise method compares the parent node and if the priority
&nbsp; *  of the parent node is less than the priority of the element to be added they will have there positions in the heap
&nbsp; *  swapped. This goes on until the priority of the parent node of the element added is either greater than or equal to
&nbsp; *  the element being added or the element being added has reached the root. This also conserves the priority for objects
&nbsp; *  with the same priority value in the order they were added to the head since the elements are not swapped when
&nbsp; *  the comparison between the priorities of the added element, and it&#39;s parent is equal. The time complexity of this
&nbsp; *  method is at most O(log_n) since the element only needs to traverse from the bottom of the tree to the root through
&nbsp; *  its parent node.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *     public void insertObject(T element) {
&nbsp; *       queueObject.add(element);
&nbsp; *      if (queueObject.size() &gt; 1) {
&nbsp; *           raise();
&nbsp; *       }
&nbsp; *      }
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *  * Returning element with the highest priority: To retrieve the element with the highest priority we would simply
&nbsp; *  look at the root node since it will always contain the element with the highest priority. This operation gives has
&nbsp; *  a time complexity of O(1).
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *     public T getRoot() {
&nbsp; *      return queueObject.getFirst();
&nbsp; *  }
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *  * Removing element with the highest priority: To remove the element with the highest priority we would first
&nbsp; *  replace the element at the end of the heap with the root. Then we would run a sink operation on the root node to
&nbsp; *  place that element in its correct position in the tree. This is done in the following order.
&nbsp; *  while index is smaller than array size assign left child the as the higher priority child
&nbsp; *  if the right child exists then compare the left and right child and assign the one with higher priority higherprioritychild
&nbsp; *  then the higherprioritychild is higher than the element priority swap the two elements positions in the heap and
&nbsp; *  continue until element is in the correct place or at the end of the heap. To conserve the priority of elements of
&nbsp; *  the same priority added if the priority of the two elements is equal than swap the elements. This is because the
&nbsp; *  element was originally located at the end of the heap suggesting it added after the parent node due to the logic of
&nbsp; *  the raise method used when adding an element. The time complexity of this operation is at most O(log_n) since it
&nbsp; *  it only has to traverse down the nodes of the tree when placing the last element that was set moved to root to
&nbsp; *  its correct place in the heap.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *     public T removeRoot() {
&nbsp; *       T root = queueObject.getFirst();
&nbsp; *       queueObject.set(0, queueObject.getLast());
&nbsp; *       queueObject.removeLast();
&nbsp; *       sink();
&nbsp; *       return root;
&nbsp; *   }
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *  * Time complexities
&nbsp; *    Insert element - O(log_n)
&nbsp; *    return root - O(1)
&nbsp; *    remove root - O(log_n)
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *   2. Object-Oriented Design:
&nbsp; *   * Implement priority queue capable of holding student objects: My design follows a few design patterns. It mostly
&nbsp; *   used behavioral pattern where I have an interface that interacts with a priorityQueue object. I&#39;m not too savvy on
&nbsp; *   the particulars of individual behavioral design pattern names, but I feel like this fits the bill. The priority
&nbsp; *   queue class abstracts the way it adds elements, removes elements, returns the root, and prints out the queue.
&nbsp; *   My implementation of the priority queue also allows inheritance with the use of generics allowing it to be used
&nbsp; *   with different data types or class objects. I have also defined another priority queue class named StudentPriorityQueue
&nbsp; *   which specifies that the queue will be using the Student class as it&#39;s data type.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *   * Define a student with class attributes; name, redID, email, gpa (0-4.0), and units taken (0-150): I created a
&nbsp; *   student class with the specified requirements. In the class I defined the constructor and added data validation
&nbsp; *   for gpa and units taken. I may be able to add more for name, redID, and email if time allows. The class also
&nbsp; *   includes methods the calculates and returns a student&#39;s priority value. It also has a method for what to print out
&nbsp; *   to console if requested.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *   * Design the priority queue operations to work seamlessly with the student class: This is enabled by the
&nbsp; *   implementation of the priority queue class to use generics instead of a single data type. Creating another
&nbsp; *   priority class, StudentPriorityQueue, that extends MyPriorityQueue, but with the data type specified as Student
&nbsp; *   objects. The key part of having the Student class work seamlessly with the priority queue class is the override
&nbsp; *   implementation of the compareTwo function which is used in the raise and sink operations.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *   3. Testing Practices: TBC
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *   4. Code Quality: Judged by professor
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *   5. Priority Calculation for Students:
&nbsp; *      (gpa * 0.3 + unitsTaken * 0.70)
&nbsp; *      Implemented in both student class and priority queue
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *    6. Printing in priority order: Printing in priority order was a challenge to figure out a way without cloning
&nbsp; *    the whole priority queue. My implementation requires the creation of a new priority queue object that will be
&nbsp; *    filled up as elements from the original queue are retrieved for printing, adding the data to a new element in
&nbsp; *    the new queue, and then removing root from the original queue to get the next priority item moved to the root.
&nbsp; *    The print methods also exhibits the use of polymorphism with the overriding of the print method.
&nbsp; *
&nbsp; *    7. Custom Priority Queue Implementation: Will be judged by professor, but I did my best to use appropriate data
&nbsp; *    structures and efficient algorithms.
